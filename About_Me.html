    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>My name</h2>
        <img src="kien.jpeg" alt="Kien Nguyen" widtb="300";>
        <p>My name is Kien Nguyen and it was given to me by my mom. It means brave and courageous</p>
        <h2>My life story</h2>
         <img class="Saigon" src="Saigon.jpeg" alt="Saigon" width="300">
        <p>I was born in the vietnamese city named Saigon on October 2010. I lived in a rural city 30 minutes away called Hoc Mon where I spent my childhood with my family. As a kid I loved to go on motorcycles with my family, go to playhouses, and eat food especially KFC. When I turned 6 my mom decided to move me and her to the United States leaving my family in Vietnam and joining with a small family of cousins I had in Marin City. My mom later settled in and got money and we moved to Corte Madera where I currently live and attend redwood. </p>
        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            <img src="soccer.jpeg" alt="Soccer" width="300">
        <p>When I was little I loved to play sports with my friends and at the time the sport that we played was soccer alot at school. Soccer was the first sport I played and now it has became my favorite sport where i dedicate and train my hardest to get better at. Other than playing soccer I love to watch soccer especially my boyhood club Tottenham Hotspur. My favorite player and childhood legend is Heung Min Son because he is the best asian asian soccer player and I look up to him because I want to be like him one day</p>
            <img src="Track.jpeg" alt="Track and Field" width="400">
        <p>Another Sport that i am enjoying right now is cross country and track and field. I am considered a really athletic runner because of my explosive pace and high endurance. Some thing that is odd that people always question about me is how I don't enjoy running like most track athletes but I am really fast and often beat people who train more than me and enjoy the thrill of the run. Well though I don't like running I sometimes get motivated to run because of my friends and My competitive mindset often gives me a chance to compete with other elite runner's. Some distances I run are a 5k in cross country and 200 meter and 400 meter in track and field.</p>
