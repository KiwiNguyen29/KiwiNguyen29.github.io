        <p>When I was little I loved to play sports with my friends and at the time the sport that we played was soccer. Soccer was the first sport I played and now it has become my favorite sport.</p>
        <p>Another Sport that i am enjoying right now is cross country and track and field. I don't enjoy running like most track athletes but when I'm with my friends, I get the motivation to run. Some distances I run are a 5k in cross country and 200 meter and 400 meter in track and field.</p>
